* Objective
  - To be able to Simulate the "Gel-based Proteomics to Analyze Human Serum Proteome" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/protein-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Gel-based proteomics to analyze bacterial proteome/Gel-based proteomics to analyze bacterial proteome_01_Usability_smk.org][Gel-based proteomics to analyze bacterial proteome_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the start button and then click on the syringe
  4. Click on the Pause button and then click on the Play button.
  5. Click on the Next button and then click on the Previous button
  6. Now click on the Play button.
  7. After completion of the each part click on the 'continue' button till the last part of the simulation
  8. Repeat 4,5 and 6 steps

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on the start button, the video should start playing
  4. When we click on the pause button, the video should be paused and when we click on the play button, the video should start playing
  5. When we click on the next button, the next video should start playing and when we click on the previous button, the previous video should start playing
  6. When we click on the play button, nothing should be happen and after the completion of the simulation the result should be displayed in the Simulation of Gel Analysis Software box.
