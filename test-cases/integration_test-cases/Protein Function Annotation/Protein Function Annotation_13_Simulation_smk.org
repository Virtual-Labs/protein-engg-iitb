* Objective
  - To be able to Simulate the "Protein Function Annotation" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/protein-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Protein Function Annotation/Protein Function Annotation_01_Usability_smk.org][Protein Function Annotation_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. click on GOanna(annotation tool) button and click on the check box present at the sequence field 
  4. Select the expected value,word size,matrix and alignment valus from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields and click on the GOanna button 
  5. Click on the back button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. After selecting the values and when we click on the GOanna button the simulation result should be displayed on the screen
