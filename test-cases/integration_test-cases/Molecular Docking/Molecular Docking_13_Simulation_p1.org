* Objective
  - To be able to Simulate the "Protein Function Annotation" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/protein-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Molecular Docking/Molecular Docking_01_Usability_smk.org][Molecular Docking_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on select protien and select the parameters and click on the start button
  4. Click on optimizing protien and minimizing protien and click on next button
  5. Click on active site identification button and give the values of no:of sites, force field and grid fields and click on start button
  6. Select the Ligand and click on the next button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The built protien should be displayed on the screen
  4. Active site identification should be displayed on the screen 
  5. The dockink score value should be displayed on the screen.
