* Objective
  - To be able to Simulate the "Homology Modelling" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/protein-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Homology Modelling/Homology Modelling_01_Usability_smk.org][Homology Modelling_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Select the dataset from the dropdown list present at the corresponding field and click on PIR format
  4. click on generate profile developer script button 
  5. click on develop profile button and click on the sequence alignment of the probable templates and select the pdb file and click the corresponding check box 
  6. Click on the next button and select the files to be compared and click on generate script to compare template and click on compare
  7. Click on generate script for model building and click on next button
  8. Select the type of molecule to be viewed and click on next button
  9. Select the type of molecule to be analyzed and click on the protien structured analysis button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. PIR format result should be displayed on the screen
  4. The profile developer script should be displayed on the screen
  5. The developed profile should be displayed on the screen
  6. Structured analysis should be displayed on the screen
  7. Sequence identity comparison should be displayed on the screen
  8. Model building script should be developed and when we click on the protein structured analysis button and the simulation result should be displayed on the screen
