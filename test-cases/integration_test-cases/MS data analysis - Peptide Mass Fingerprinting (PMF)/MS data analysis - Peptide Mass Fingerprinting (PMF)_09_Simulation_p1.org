* Objective
  - To be able to Simulate the "MS Data Analysis- Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF)" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/protein-engg-iitb/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/MS data analysis - Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF)/MS data analysis - Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF)_01_Usability_smk.org][MS data analysis - Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF)_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the start button 
  4. Don't select the values and click on the start search button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on the start button, an error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the database, taxonomy and peptide tol values
